# pio-parser

Support for the Raspberry Silicon RP2040's *PIO* State Machines asm syntax.

## What is pio-parser

This crate can parse PIO asm syntax. It is part of [pio](https://crates.io/pio).

## PIO Examples

This crate is just the PIO syntax parser. If you want to see some fully-featured
PIO examples integrated with Embedded Rust on the RP2040, check out the
[rp-hal examples](https://github.com/rp-rs/rp-hal/tree/main/rp2040-hal/examples).

## Roadmap

NOTE This tool is under active development. As such, it is likely to remain
volatile until a 1.0.0 release.

See the [open issues](https://github.com/rp-rs/pio-rs/issues) for a list of
proposed features (and known issues).
