## Unreleased

Add unreleased changes here

## 0.6.1 - 2023-11-28

- Use `feature()` on nightly toolchains only. This adds support for 1.75 beta and stable.

## 0.6.0 - 2023-10-02

- Prohibit `Write::write` implementations returning `Ok(0)` unless there is no
  data to write; consequently remove `WriteAllError`.
  Update the `&mut [u8]` impl to possibly return
  a new `SliceWriteError` if the slice is full instead of `Ok(0)`.
- Add `WriteZero` variant to `ErrorKind` for implementations that previously
  may have returned `Ok(0)` to indicate no further data could be written.
- `Write::write_all` now panics if the `write()` implementation returns `Ok(0)`.

## 0.5.0 - 2023-08-06

- First release
